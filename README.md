#### Introduction

As a developer (dev) you are sometimes required to prove your knowledge to prospective clients and employers.

A common way clients assess this for a specific project is to release a Request for Quotation (RfQ). A RfQ can take many forms, but in general it is a questionnaire covering technical and commercial topics. This Workbook emulates the technical section of a RfQ.

#### Brief

The ACME Corporation is interested in building a marketplace web application (app) using Rails for one of it’s product lines. To help it choose the vendor who will undertake the project they have released a RfQ. As an aspiring junior dev at an up and coming Sydney software startup (CAx-Dev) your manager has assigned you to assist with preparation of the RfQ response.

You are assigned (required) to complete all the questions from the technical section of the RfQ - which are presented below.

Being a highly valued junior dev you are expected to continue working on your other ongoing projects and schedule time for this project accordingly.

#### Questions

##### Details:

ACME Corporation is looking for devs with an understanding of Rails. The following set of questions relate to this RfQ-requirement.

## Q1

Describe the architecture of a typical Rails application. [200-300]

**Answer:**

Ruby on Rails is a software framework used for web development. An extension of the Ruby programming language, Ruby on Rails (or Rails as it is often called) utilises Ruby and combines it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server..
Rails applies the model-view-controller (MVC) software design pattern for it's architecture. This architectural pattern seperates the application into three primary components: model, view and controller - each with it's own responsibilities.
The model represents the central component of the design pattern and manages the behaviour and data of the data of the application 


As per the Rails API, the model layer represents the domain model
This structure is present within the file structure of the Rails application. Rails also directly refers to this design pattern with it's classes: namely the ActionController, ActionView and ActiveRecord, each representing the controller, view and model respectively. Each of these classes or objects are organised in a hierarchy of classes defined further in the Rails API.
[Reference](http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html)

It also follows the convention over configuration rule, which is also known as Coding by convention. This means, that it has already taken a few decisions for you and you don’t have to worry about those things until you follow ROR conventions.

## Q3

Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology. [200-300]

**Answer:**

## Q4

Provide an overview and description of a standard source control workflow. [100-200]
Source control workflow refers to the recommended steps and procedure adhered to in a source control environment. Developers utilising a source control system can contribute and work in different ways. The workflow concept is a design that defines the rules versioning, branching and the control of the master branch.
[Reference](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

A popular standard workflow practiced by developers is the centralized workflow.
In a centralized workflow, developers all contribute to a shared repository (as opposed to fork-pull workflow). This central repository is often created and hosted on source control hosting services such as Bitbucket or GitHub.

Developers begin by cloning from the central repository. Developers will make changes and edit files committing locally and synchronising upstream at a convenient time.

Publishing to the central repository, "pushing"
