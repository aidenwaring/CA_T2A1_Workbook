#### Introduction

As a developer (dev) you are sometimes required to prove your knowledge to prospective clients and employers.

A common way clients assess this for a specific project is to release a Request for Quotation (RfQ). A RfQ can take many forms, but in general it is a questionnaire covering technical and commercial topics. This Workbook emulates the technical section of a RfQ.
